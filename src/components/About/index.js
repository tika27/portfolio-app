            <p>
            I have recently graduated from coding boot-camp from University of Denver. 
            I enjoy taking complex problem and turning them into simple and beautiful interface designs. I also love
            the logic and structure of coding and always strive to write elegant and efficient 
            code. Whether it be HTML, CSS or REACT.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
            When i'm not coding, you will find me in the mountain hiking or enjoying the mother nature.
            </p>
